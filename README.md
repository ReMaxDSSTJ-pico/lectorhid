This is a semi-port of the PCPROX reader for 125Khz RFID readers from PCPROX/WAVEID using GCC C 
It happens there is a repository and a library for Phyton that reads the PCPROX using Phyton and USB HID.
But I don't know to write on Phyton and I am lazy. So I ported the existing program from <micolous/pcpro>
to create my own program in C.

I use VS Code to edit, and compile with make, using a Makefile.
I really don't like VS Code but it's free and I have to use it. And I waste too much time finding and searching
how the VS Code works, with those entangled .json files.
